         After club car wash bought out my former car wash, I decided to join their team. At this position I was the Sales Consultant and my base pay was $15 an hour plus 50 cent commision per membership I sold. I went from taking $1800 home a month to $3,000. I was out selling memberships in all of Missouri, but I only won monthly competitions because I clocked the most hours. No one needs to know that though. 
         
         During my time their I made many amazing friends and I really enjoyed the managers I got. I was able to meet Travis Kelce since he his part owner of the company. The first day I met him, in our converstaion I asked him what he did for a living. Needless to say, I only cared about Patrick Mahomes during that time.
         
        Eventualy, their was some aligations about the manager that wasn't very moral so I decided to leave because I knew it was true. Looking back, I regret working there for many different reasons but it did give me sales and experience that I a thankful for. 
        
        Below is a table of the memberships that I would sell at Club Car Wash. 
        
        | *Package*  | *Price* |
        | `Rookie`    | $20     |
        | `VIP`       | $27     |
        | `Elite`     | $32     |
        | `MVP`       | $40     |
