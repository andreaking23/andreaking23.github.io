            Being an accountant assistant was my very first job in November 2016 at a car wash. It was locally owned so the manager allowed me to work underneath the accountant and gave me plenty of time to adjust and learn the different programs we would use. I stayed there for six years starting at $7.65.  
            
            During those six years I did the bi-weekly reports, printed checks, and helped my boss during tax season. My favorite part of the job was networking to different companies. One week I could call the local prisions and offer jobs to anyone who was getting released so they could get back on their feet. I was in charge of social media accounts and updating their websites. 
            
            I met many different friends their, some not great influences and some really bad influences. I met a ray of different personalities and I am thankful for the street knowledge and slang that I learned at such a young age. The number one reason I stayed so long was because of the manager. I was the only girl who worked their and he protected me like a dad would, and that helped in many different situations. I left that job in 2022 when they got bought out and I left at a rate of $12.00 an hour.
