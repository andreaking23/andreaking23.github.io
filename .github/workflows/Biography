            Hello, my name is Andrea King. I wanted to make this website to display my job experiences and skills that I have gained in the last four years. During this time I always worked full time and sometimes two jobs at once. I always wanted to be in a sorority, live in Columbia, or take classes in person. Though I did not get the college experience I wanted, I do have such wonderful memories with my coworkers. Plus, this allowed me to really find out what a 40+ hour work week feels like and the importance of picking a good degree to support a happy life.
            
            I graduated high school at 16 years old and I am getting my bachelor's degree at the age of 20. I have more time in my life compared to the average college graduate but I would not recommend this journey of nickling and diming your way through college as fast as you can. But if I think about other's journey in depth I may get too jealous and lose track of my own. 
            
            Growing up, I always wanted to travel! My family was so big and we rarely went out of the state. Once I got to college for pre med, I found myself saving more money for flight tickets then saving for college. I decided to switch my major to General Studies and attend an aviation school in Indianapolis after graduation. Thankfully, after this decision my spending habits got a lot better.
