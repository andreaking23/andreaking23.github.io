            My sophmore year, I was watching TedTalks about going to med school. The guy said, "If you want to be anything other than be a doctor, go do that or else you will be miserable." I realized that their were hundreds of different things that I wanted to do, specifically traveling, in comparrison to being a medical doctor. First, I searched how much much a flight attendant made and what they did, I wasn't intrested. Then I did some research about becoming a pilot, I was intrigued. That next weekend I went to Jeff City and flew a Piper for the very first time. 
            
            I reseached a few aviation schools and flew some different brands of Pipers. The most recent hour I clocked was in Tampa, FL at the ATP aviation school. The cost was over $200,000 after everything was said and done and when I went to go visit their school, I had a gut feeling that it wasn't for me. Their program is extremely accelerated which is flashy and attractive until you see how many students fail or drop out. 
            
            I found an aviation school in Indianapolis for $30,000 and I have a teaching job lined up for June. Debt is in the top five on the list of what I am affrai of. This will allow me to pay rent, continue teaching, and go to aviation school. I am more than thrilled to begin a new chapter after graduation.
