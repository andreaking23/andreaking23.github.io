            After I finished up at Club Car Wash I obtained a job as a preschool teacher. This is the best job that I have ever had and I could also see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I was assgned to teach in the one's room and I want to start out in saying that when teachers say they don't have favorites, they are lying. I loved all of my children so much but once they are around 18 months, they are much more aware of their surroundings and needs. 
            
            I loved tecahing so much because it is hard to hate your job when you get thousands of hugs a day and you can actively see all of the progress they are making. It was rewarding to have such meaningful relationships with the students and families. So many people have told me that since they are so young, it's not really teaching. However, I got to witness them learn every shape, color, and letter before they turned two. 
            
            The firend group that I have made at the school was a wonderful suprise. I was the lead teacher overseeing two coteachers and I was so blessed to meet the best women to work with. I have learned how to have difficult conversations, manage my time wisley, and work without thinking about the check amount I would be recieving.
